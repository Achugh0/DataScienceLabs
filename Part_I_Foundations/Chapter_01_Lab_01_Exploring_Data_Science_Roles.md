## Part 1: The Four Pillars of Data Science

### Exercise 1.1: Pillar Identification
For each scenario below, identify which pillar(s) of data science are primarily involved:
- **Statistics & Mathematics**
- **Computer Science & Programming**
- **Domain Expertise**
- **Communication & Storytelling**

**Scenarios:**
1. A data scientist calculates confidence intervals for A/B test results
2. A team builds a distributed processing pipeline to handle terabytes of user data
3. A healthcare analyst interprets patient readmission patterns
4. A data scientist presents insights to the C-suite with compelling visualizations

**Your Answers:**
```
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________
4. _______________
```

## Part 2: Role Research Activity

### Exercise 2.1: Compare Data Roles
Research and complete the comparison table:

| Aspect | Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Data Engineer | ML Engineer |
|--------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Primary Focus** | | | | |
| **Key Tools** | | | | |
| **Typical Output** | | | | |
| **Math Intensity** | | | | |
| **Coding Level** | | | | |

### Exercise 2.2: Job Posting Analysis
Go to LinkedIn, Indeed, or another job board. Find **one job posting** for each role:
- Data Analyst
- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer

**For each posting, answer:**
1. What are the top 3 required skills?
2. What tools/technologies are mentioned?
3. What is the expected education level?
4. Which pillar of data science seems most emphasized?

## Part 3: The Project Lifecycle

### Exercise 3.1: Lifecycle Sequencing
Put these data science project phases in the correct order:

- [ ] Model Deployment
- [ ] Data Collection
- [ ] Problem Definition
- [ ] Model Evaluation
- [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] Feature Engineering
- [ ] Model Training
- [ ] Communication of Results

**Correct Order:**
```
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________
4. _______________
5. _______________
6. _______________
7. _______________
8. _______________
```

### Exercise 3.2: Real-World Case Study
Read this scenario:

> **Scenario:** A retail company wants to reduce customer churn. They have 5 years of customer transaction data, including purchases, returns, customer service interactions, and demographic information.

**Your Task:** Map out a complete project lifecycle for this problem:

1. **Problem Definition:** What specific question would you try to answer?
2. **Data Collection:** What data would you need? What might be missing?
3. **EDA:** What patterns would you look for?
4. **Feature Engineering:** Name 3 features you might create
5. **Model Selection:** What type of model might work? (don't worry if you don't know details yet)
6. **Evaluation:** How would you measure success?
7. **Deployment:** How might this model be used in production?
8. **Communication:** Who would you present results to?

## Part 4: Setting Up Your Environment

### Exercise 4.1: Google Colab Setup
1. Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Rename it "My_First_Data_Science_Notebook"
4. In the first cell, type and run:
   ```python
   print("Hello, Data Science!")
   import sys
   print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
   ```
5. Take a screenshot and save it

### Exercise 4.2: Colab Exploration
In your Colab notebook, explore and document:
1. How to add a new code cell
2. How to add a text (markdown) cell
3. How to upload a file
4. Where to find keyboard shortcuts
5. How to save your notebook to Google Drive

**Write your findings below:**
```
1. Adding code cell: _______________
2. Adding text cell: _______________
3. Uploading files: _______________
4. Shortcuts location: _______________
5. Saving to Drive: _______________
```
